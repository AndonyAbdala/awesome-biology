An attempt to collect a curated list of awesome learning resources, research
papers, tools and other resources related to Biology. This is inspired from
several such lists in programming community.

request](https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/awesome-biology/compare/), [open an
issue](https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/awesome-biology/issues/new) or contact
through [email](mailto:vivekraiiitkgp@gmail.com). When sending suggestions
please add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally
read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc.  irrespective
of any particular field or subject area.
